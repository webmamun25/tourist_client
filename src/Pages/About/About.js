        That’s exactly what an effective travel website should make you feel. It
        should activate the travel bug with vibrant imagery and vivid copy. And
        while photos can do a lot of the work in inspiring visitors, a travel
        site can’t accomplish its purpose without great web design. Web design
        plays a major role in visitors’ first impressions of a business. In
        fact, in one study, when participants were asked why they distrusted a
        website, 94% of the comments were about design. For a travel site, this
        means that design can be the determining factor in whether a visitor
        trusts recommendations and information. And considering the significant
        investments that go into planning a trip, trust is essential. It can
        make or break a traveler’s decision to take a certain tour, stay at a
        certain hotel, or even visit a city or country altogether. Plus, beyond
        serving as a trustworthy source of inspiration, a travel site also needs
        to give would-be travelers all the information they need to arrange
        their travel plans. Once a visitor is convinced that they need to see
        the sights in the photos for themselves, it should be easy for them to
        plan their trip. This means that the site needs to have straightforward
        travel information, helpful logistical details, and tips that will help
        visitors simplify the travel process. Not all travel sites tick all of
        these boxes, but the ones that do stand out from all the rest. So
        whether you’re considering launching a new travel site, or you’re ready
        to improve an existing one, you want to make sure you leave no stone
        unturned.
