        For starters, explore Paris by visiting the famous Eiffel Tower where
        you can enjoy the views of the metropolis. Secure a direct access, so
        you won’t have to queue at the entrance. You can combine your Eiffel
        tour with an hour-long ride on the Seine with wonderful views and with a
        visit to the Louvre Museum. The world’s largest museum exhibits more
        than 35,000 items, which you can wonder at all day long with a ticket
        that will enable you to jump the queue. If you’re interested to find out
        more about the museum, you can join a tour in the company of an
        experienced guide. You can see whole Paris from the roof terrace of the
        Montparnasse Tower.
